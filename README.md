# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to my sorting visualizer repository! This project is mostly a means for me to get more familiar with SDL2, though it could also prove useful to programming students who wish to understand the mechanics behind each algorithm/ 

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler that supports C++20 
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.16+

## Usage

To build the executable from the project directory run: 

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./SortingVisualizer # Run the executable
```

## Future Features

In the future I plan to work on the following features:

- Additional sorting algorithms
- Runtime generation of datasets
- Runtime choice of algorithm
